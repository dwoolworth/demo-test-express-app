My Express Server Example
================================

A very simple Express server example that's setup to use babel and other "helpers"
to set a boilerplate/template for future work or to play around with.

To install:
``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

To build:
``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm build:all
```

To run transpiled code:
``` bash
$ npm run start
```
